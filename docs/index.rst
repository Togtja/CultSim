Lua Guide
=========

Welcome to the CultSim Lua API user guide. In the following sections you will be introduced to the Lua API in
CultSim by creating your first very simple scenario. Hopefully, along the way, you'll pick up some skills that
are needed to develop your own scenarios in the future, and getting the most out of CultSim!

A sample simulation
-------------------

To begin, we will create a very simple scenario using the default assets available to you in CultSim.

Lua API Reference
-----------------

In this section you'll find a complete reference over all the tools available to you in the CultSim Lua API.



C++ API Reference
=================

This section contains an API dump of all types and methods documented in the C++ implementation of CultSim, and is not
recommeneded to read by people mainly interested in the Lua API and scripting as it will not give you very much. If
you are very interested in the inner workings of CultSim, you may of course read it, or check out the source code directly.

The following is a dump of everything in the CultSim (cs) namespace, good luck:
